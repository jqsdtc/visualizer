## Introduction

The aim of this project is to show how do some pathfinding and sorting algorithms work. 

It comes along with an [online demo]( https://jqsdtc.github.io/visualizer/ ) to show how the algorithms execute.  (The gird of pathfinding visualizer changes according to the window size) 

This project only provides path-finding and sorting algorithms for 2D space.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

 Make sure you have `node.js` installed, then use `npm` to install the dependencies: 

```
npm install -d 
```

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in the browser. 

## Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms:

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): guarantees the shortest path

**A\* Search** (weighted): uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Breath-first Search** (unweighted):  guarantees the shortest path

**Depth-first Search** (unweighted): does not guarantee the shortest path

**Quicksort** : divide-and-conquer algorithm

**Merge sort** : divide-and-conquer algorithm

**Bubble sort** : simple comparison algorithm
